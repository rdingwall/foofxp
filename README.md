**FooFXP** is a text-based FTP client for unix systems. It is written in C++, using [ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) and [Boost.Asio](www.boost.org/libs/asio/).

#### Features

* Curses-based text user interface
* Multiple concurrent sessions and transfers
* Event-driven, single threaded async code
* Favourites (bookmark) manager
* AUTH SSL and TLS encryption via [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/)
* Site-to-site transfers (FXP)
* Win32/Win64 support via [PDCurses](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pdcurses.htm)

#### Current Project Status

FooFXP development is currently **halted**. Due to time commitments is looking unlikely to be ever completed, and the code is now posted here in the hopes that it may be of benefit to someone somewhere.
